Lab 4 - Synchronization
***********************

Part 1 Completed:
* Makefile, checkdist
* Function "add" and options...
	--threads=# (default 1)
	--iterations=# (default 1)
	--iter=# (same as above)


Part 2 Completed:
* 


Part 1 TODO:
* Tester program
* Function "add" and options...
	--yield=#
	--sync=m (protect with pthread_mutex)
	--sync=s (protect with spin-lock)
	--sync=c (protect with atomic operation compare-and-swap)
* Implement output text
* Graphs comparing unprotected, mutex, spin-lock, compare-and-swap
	performance vs number of threads 
	performance vs number of iterations
* Short answers to questions posed in spec


Part 2 TODO:
* Functions for a sorted doubly linked list (SortedList.h)
	insert
	delete
	lookup
	length
* sltest (tester program)
	--threads=#
	--iterations=#
	--iter=# (same as above)
	--yield=[ids] (i for insert, d for delete, s for searches)
	--lists=#
* Implement output text
* Graphs
	average time per unprotected operation vs number of iteration (single thread)
	average time per operation (for none, mutex, and spin-lock) vs number of threads
	average time per operation (for none, mutex, and spin-lock) vs the ratio of threads per list
* Short answers to questions posed in spec


Part 3 TODO:
* Short answers to questions posed in spec
